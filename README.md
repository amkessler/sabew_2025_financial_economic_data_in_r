This repository contains the code used for the R presentation given at the 2025 Society of American Business Editors & Writers [conference](https://sabew.org/event/sabew25/) in Arlington, Va.

To install the packages you'll need to run this demonstration, you can run this line in the console within RStudio:

`install.packages(c("tidyverse", "lubridate", "janitor", "tidyquant", "writexl", "googlesheets4", "usethis", "DT"))`

You can clone this repository, or if you would like to both download/launch this project within RStudio with one line of code, you can run this in the console:

`usethis::use_course("https://github.com/amkessler/sabew_2025_financial_economic_data_in_r/archive/refs/heads/main.zip")`

A rendered web page of the walkthrough can be found here: <https://amkessler.github.io/sabew_2025_financial_economic_data_in_r/>
